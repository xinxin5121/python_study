    "## Jupyter Notebook <a id='section1'></a>\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modal user interface <a id='subsection1.1'></a>\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook has a modal user interface. This means that the keyboard does different things depending on which mode the Notebook is in. There are two modes: **edit mode** and **command mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Edit mode\n",
    "Edit mode is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/XiongPengNUS/dao_resources/blob/main/edit_mode.jpg?raw=true\" width=750>\n",
    "- Edit the content of a cell\n",
    "- Press <code>enter</code> (<code>return</code> for Mac OS) to enable edit mode, and <code>esc</code> to quit editing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command mode\n",
    "Command mode is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/XiongPengNUS/dao_resources/blob/main/command_mode.jpg?raw=true\" width=762>\n",
    "- Notebook level actions: insert/remove cells, and change cell types, etc.\n",
    "- Keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "    - <code>A</code>: insert a cell above\n",
    "    - <code>B</code>: insert a cell below\n",
    "    - <code>D</code>, <code>D</code>: delete a cell\n",
    "    - <code>M</code>: change to markdown mode\n",
    "    - <code>Y</code>: change to code mode\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other keyboard shortcuts\n",
    "- <code>ctrl</code> + <code>enter</code> (<code>control</code> + <code>enter</code> for Mac OS): run cells\n",
    "- <code>shift</code> + <code>enter</code> (<code>shift</code> + <code>return</code> for Mac OS): run cells, and select (insert) the cell below \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a code cell is executed, there will be a number appearing in the square bracket in front of the cell, indicating the sequence of executing cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Try Jupyter Notebook as a scientific calculator <a id='subsection1.2'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operators and operands\n",
    "In many programming languages, **operators** are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values the operator is applied to are called **operands**. The commonly used math operators of Python are presented in the table below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operator | Description | Example | Result\n",
    ":--------|:------------|:--------|:------\n",
    "<code>+</code> | addition | <code>5 + 8</code> | 13\n",
    "<code>-</code> | subtraction | <code>9 - 2</code> | 7\n",
    "<code>*</code> | multiplication | <code>4 * 7</code> | 28\n",
    "<code>/</code> | float point division | <code>7 / 2</code> | 3.5\n",
    "<code>//</code> | integer (truncating) division | <code>7 / 2</code> | 3\n",
    "<code>%</code> | modulus (remainder) | <code>7 % 2</code> | 1\n",
    "<code>**</code> | exponentiation | <code>3 ** 4</code> | 81\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that many of the operators are consistent with a scientific calculator, which enables us to do some simple calculations as follows."
